# Arduino Scope XY Test
Using an Arduino to draw simple Oscilloscope XY art using PWM

This Arduino project is a modification of the original found at
http://www.johngineer.com/blog/?p=648

The original graphic was enhanced, a simple square graphic was added,
and by commenting out various sections and enabling others, either of the 
three graphics can be generated, or a slideshow of all three can be 
played back on the oscilloscope.
